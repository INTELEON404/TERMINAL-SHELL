    Sanitize Inputs: Validate and filter all user inputs.
    Restrict Commands: Use a whitelist of allowed commands.
    Sandbox Environment: Run the application in a restricted environment.
    Disable shell_exec: Consider safer alternatives for production use.

This project is for educational purposes and should not be deployed publicly without proper security measures.
