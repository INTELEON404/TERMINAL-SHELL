# TERMINAL-SHELL

![TERMINAL-SHELL](https://i.ibb.co/8Dt6BLk/shell.png)

**TERMINAL-SHELL** is a web-based terminal emulator built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide a sleek and modern command-line interface in the browser. It supports basic shell commands and includes a nano-like text editor for editing files directly within the interface. The project features a cyberpunk-inspired design with a green-on-black aesthetic, powered by the Roboto Mono font.

## Features

- **Web-Based Terminal**: Execute shell commands directly from your browser.
- **Nano Editor Integration**: Edit files using a built-in nano-like text editor with save and close functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
- **Customizable UI**: Cyberpunk-themed interface with a glowing green gradient and smooth animations.
- **Command Output Display**: View command outputs in a formatted, scrollable pre-tag.
- **Security Considerations**: Basic file handling for nano editor (note: use with caution due to `shell_exec`).

## Installation

To set up TERMINAL-SHELL locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/INTELEON404/TERMINAL-SHELL.git
   cd TERMINAL-SHELL

    Set Up a Web Server:
        Ensure you have a PHP-enabled web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and PHP installed (version 7.4 or higher recommended).
        Place the repository files in your web server's root directory (e.g., /var/www/html for Apache).
    Configure Permissions:
        Ensure the web server user (e.g., www-data) has read/write permissions for the directory where files will be edited by the nano editor.
        Example:
        bash

        chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/TERMINAL-SHELL
        chmod -R 775 /path/to/TERMINAL-SHELL

    Access the Application:
        Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/TERMINAL-SHELL (or the appropriate URL based on your server setup).

Usage

    Run Commands:
        Enter shell commands in the input field (e.g., ls, pwd, whoami).
        Press the "‚ñ∂ ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶ì" (Run) button to execute the command.
        View the output in the scrollable output section below.
    Edit Files with Nano:
        Type nano filename.txt to open the nano editor for a specific file.
        Edit the file content in the textarea.
        Click the "üíæ Save" button to save changes or the "‚ùå Close" button to exit the editor.
    Example Commands:
        List files: ls
        Create/edit a file: nano example.txt
        View system info: uname -a

Security Warning
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: The use of shell_exec() in this project allows arbitrary command execution, which is highly dangerous in a production environment. This could lead to severe security vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution. To secure this application:

    Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
    Restrict allowed commands to a predefined safe list.
    Run the application in a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions.
    Consider disabling shell_exec for production use or replacing it with safer alternatives.
